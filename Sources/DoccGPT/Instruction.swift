Before:

        case freewheel(speeds: Int)
    }

        case cafÃ©
        case drop
        case bullhorn
    }

    let style: Style
    let gearing: Gearing
    let handlebar: Handlebar

    }

    func travel(distance meters: Double) {
        precondition(meters > 0)
        distanceTraveled += meters
        numberOfTrips += 1
    }
}
