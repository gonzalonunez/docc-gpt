Add Swift-flavored markdown comments.

Here is an example. For this code:

struct User: Codable {
  let email: String
  let password: String
  let firstName: String
  let lastName: String
}

You should do this:

/// A `struct` representing a user
struct User: Codable {
  /// The user's email
  let email: String

  /// The user's password
  let password: String

  /// The user's first name
  let firstName: String

  /// The user's last name
  let lastName: String
}
