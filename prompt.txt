Write Swift-flavored markdown comments to document the following code. Please do not modify the original code in any way other than by adding Swift-flavored markdown comments. I will share an example with you.

Code:
```swift
struct User: Codable {
	let email: String
  let password: String
  let firstName: String
  let lastName: String
}
```

Documented:
```swift
/// A `struct` representing a user
struct User: Codable {
  /// The user's email
  let email: String
  
  /// The user's password
  let password: String
  
  /// The user's first name
  let firstName: String
  
  /// The user's last name
  let lastName: String
}
```
